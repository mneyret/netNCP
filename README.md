## Quantifying the impacts of socio-ecosystem change through expanded ecosystem multifunctionality - netNCP tutorial

This tutorial introduces the **netNCP approach** through a simple, fictional case study.  
It illustrates the main concepts and calculation steps used to quantify how changes in social
and ecological systems affect ecosystem multifunctionality.

The tutorial accompanies the paper by **Neyret et al. (2026)**, *Quantifying the impacts of socio-ecosystem change through expanded ecosystem multifunctionality*, published in *Advances in Ecological Research*.
